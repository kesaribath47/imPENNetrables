MITM to fast brute-force TLS encryption with chosen plaintext attack (this attack doesn't cause error on atm/bank if the AMOUNT value doens't contain 0). The general idea is that AES has fixed 128-bit block size, which potentially leaks the plain text length if carefully pad the message to align with AES block size. With a sequence of withdraws, brute-force is done iterately for each digit of the unknown amount with max 100 attempts.
